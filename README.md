# Graph Visualization Exercise ðŸŒ³

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for taking on our frontend coding exercise. We've put together this task to see how you approach building interactive UI components and organize your code. Don't worry - we're not looking for perfection, but rather your thought process and coding style.

## The Task

Your mission is to create a graph visualization screen that allows users to explore connected nodes and their relationships. The main features include:

- Display an interactive graph using React Flow
- Implement a popover that appears when clicking on nodes
- Style the components to match the provided design
- Ensure smooth interactions and state management

You can find the design to implement here:

Here's what we'll be looking at:

- Component organization and reusability
- Clean and maintainable CSS implementation
- State management approach
- TypeScript usage and type safety
- Overall code structure and readability

## Tech Stack

We've set up the project with some modern tools to help you get started quickly:

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling
- **React Flow** - Graph visualization library
- **shadcn/ui** - Component library
- **TypeScript** - For type safety

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## What We're Looking For

- **Component Structure**: How you break down the UI into reusable components
- **CSS Organization**: Clean use of Tailwind and custom styles where needed
- **State Management**: Efficient handling of graph data and UI state
- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, and well-documented code
- **TypeScript**: Proper type definitions and usage
